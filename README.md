# Feature Selection Techniques Notebook

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of **feature selection techniques**, which are crucial for improving model performance and reducing computational complexity. The goal is to identify and retain the most significant features from a dataset while discarding irrelevant or redundant ones.

## Techniques Covered

The notebook includes examples of the following widely-used feature selection methods:

1. **Filter Methods**:
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies features with a high correlation to the target variable and low correlation with each other.
   - **Chi-Square Test**: Evaluates the dependency between categorical features and the target variable.
   - **Mutual Information**: Measures the mutual dependence between features and the target.

2. **Wrapper Methods**:
   - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Iteratively removes the least important features based on model performance.
   - **Forward/Backward Feature Selection**: Adds or removes features one at a time, based on performance metrics.

3. **Embedded Methods**:
   - **Tree-Based Feature Selection**: Uses importance scores from decision trees or ensembles like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
